# Hand-Foot Coordination

A game developed for the [Awkward Arcade](http://awkwardarcade.co.uk/) project.

Score the longest streak by grabbing the right items with the righ part of your body. **Hint:** footballs with your feet, basketballs with your hands.

The game is controlled with two buttons, one for your hand and, you guessed it, one for your foot. The idea is to make the players uncomfortable and make their brains overheat.

Built in my spare time with [Phaser](http://phaser.io/), cups of tea and stubbornness.
